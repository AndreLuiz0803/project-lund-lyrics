                I brought you light <br>
                But you'd rather live in the dark <br>
                We always fight <br>
                Don't even know what is the cause <br>
                Still asking why <br>
                Fuck it babe, what is the point <br>
                You're feeding me lies <br>
                And I'm tired of playing the part <br>
                You broke me down <br>
                I'm nothing but marrow and bone <br>
                Rot to the core <br>
                Chewed up and spit on the floor <br>
                I'm leaving now <br>
                Can't take this shit anymore <br>
                And if you're holding me down <br>
                Then why am I outta control <br>
                It's our oldest deadliest impulse <br>
                The need to protect our own at the expense of any other living thing <br>
                And we give that impulse such a nice name, don't we? Love <br>

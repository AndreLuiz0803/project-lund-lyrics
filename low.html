                Low now, feelin' low now <br>
                This divide inside my mind, I might lose control now <br>
                Demons feedin' on my soul, I'm a fuckin' ghost now <br>
                And there's nothin' in my chest but a fuckin' hole now (hole now) <br>

                There's a war inside my mind, drugs could dull it all down <br>
                Broken hearts and wasted time, tryna work it all out <br>
                Take a look inside my eyes, got a heart of stone now (stone now) <br>

                See inside my core, know you were my everything <br>
                Without you, have nothing left so I'mma let this pistol sing <br>

                Whiskey with the cyanide, empty bottle by my bed <br>

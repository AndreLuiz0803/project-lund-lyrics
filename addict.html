                    Whiskey on my breath <br>
                    My only pray to God <br>
                    Is to ask for death <br>
                    I still smell your perfume <br>
                    Like u never left <br>
                    Missin' late nights <br>
                    She leave hickeys on my neck

                Empty bottle <br>
                Numbing all the pain <br>
                Wake up in the morning <br>
                Circumstance is still the same <br>
                Having trouble trying maintain <br>
                Sanity inside my damn brain <br>
                Fuck a bitch and then I get paid <br>
                They wonder why I’m so lonely <br>

                Cause I don't need no help <br>
                Bitch I do it all on my own <br>
                Doing numbers you’ll never see <br>

                There's a lot of snakes <br>
                That gonna slither through the game <br>
                Try to take advantage of your lil' bit of fame <br>
                That's why I don’t work <br>
                Unless I’m mother fucking paid <br>
                Young kid with some intuition <br>

                They told me I could never be <br>
                Everything that I am now <br>
                All I got is room to grow <br>
                Cause there's no more breaking me down <br>
                Been at the bottom to long <br>
                Harboring emotion to put into songs <br>
                You think you know me <br>
                You got it all wrong <br>
